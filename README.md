## Debian Installation
1. Install a minimal installation of Debian stable using **Debian-Minimal-Install.md** as a guide.
	- **Do not** set a root password. Set yourself up as primary user. This will automatically give you sudo access.
	- **Do not** create a swap partition. The `install.sh` script will install ZRam for swap unless it detects swap is already present.
	- Highly recommend setting up a separate home partition. It makes life easier.
2. In the software selection page:
	- Uncheck all desktop environments.
	- Check SSH server. SSH is used to administer all Linux systems on MosfaNet. (Shouldn't be needed in a VM.)
	- Check Standard system utilities.
3. Reboot
## i3 Installation
Once system has rebooted, run the following:
```bash
$ sudo apt install git network-manager	# if not installed during Debian installation
$ git clone https://github.com/RickRomig/i3wm-debian.git ~/i3wm-debian
$ cd i3wm-debian
$ ./install.sh
$ ./nerdfonts.sh
$ ./configs.sh
$ micro .config/polybar/config.ini	# Edit wlan, eth, and battery modules as needed.
$ sudo reboot
```
## NOTES
- The `install.sh` script clones the configs and scripts repositories to ~/Downloads.
- The `install.sh` script copies the contents of the script repository from ~/Downloads/scripts to ~/bin.
- The `configs.sh` script copies or links configuration files from ~/Downloads/configs to ~/.config.
- Configure Polybar modules for network and battery, as applicable, before rebooting after i3 installation.
## Set screen resolution in Gnome-Boxes VM
Add `display-setup-script=xrandr -s 1920x1080` in the `[Seat:*]` section as shown below:

display-setup-script=xrandr -s 1920x1080
#type=xlocal
#pam-service=lightdm
#pam-autologin-service=lightdm-autologin
